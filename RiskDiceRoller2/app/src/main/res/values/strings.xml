<!-- strings.xml - Because it needs to exist for some reason
All strings used in xml are here, android studio has a hissy fit if you just put it in quotes
This is technically supposed to be easier for changes in the future, which I agree, but it is also really annoying
Layout of how to add more strings is pretty obvious-->

<resources>

    <string name="app_name">RiskDiceRoller</string>
    <string name="action_settings">Settings</string>
    <string name="attacker_armies">Number of attacking armies</string>
    <string name="defender_armies">Number of defending armies</string>
    <string name="attacker_ll">Attacker armies lower limit</string>
    <string name="battle">Battle</string>
    <string name="title_activity_battle">Battle Results</string>
    <string name="another_battle">Start Another Battle</string>

</resources>
